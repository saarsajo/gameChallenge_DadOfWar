The Dad: Ugh... My head...

The Dad: Must have crashed the boat...

The Dad: The Boy? Where is the Boy?

The Dad: BOOOY?

The Dad: 

By the Gods! I have to find the boy.

These woods are full of dangers.




The Boy of the Dad: Oh hello dad.. sir

The Dad: Boy! Are you allright?

The Boy of the Dad: Yeah, I washed up here and couldn't move because of the Icicle-Giant, other than that I'm fine.

The Dad: Good. 

The Boy of the Dad: The boat seems to be impact too. See?

The Dad: Hmph good. We can countinue our journey. We still need to take your mothers trashes to the highest peak in all the realms.

The Boy of the Dad: I still don't understand. Why couldn't we put the carbage to the bin next to our house...

The Dad: It was her wish.

The Boy of the Dad: Wierd wish.

The Dad: It would do you good to stay silent. The path a head is difficult.. and you are clearly not ready. 

The Boy of the Dad: Whats the worst that could happen?

The Dad: I'm a dad boy, from another land, far from here and I have seen what happens when you define a mom. 

The Dad: Besides the fish bones from yesterday... Yyhg...

The Boy of the Dad: Ok ok sorry for asking.

The Dad: Dont be sorry be better.

The Boy of the Dad: ...Father of the year 2018...
